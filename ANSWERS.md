1. PropTypes are used to check the types of the props being passed to React
components. It's important to type check because it can greatly reduce the need
to debug one's code later on. By simply checking a prop's type, a developer can
prevent future bugs from occurring.

2. Life-cycle events are just that--they are events that occur over the course
of a React component's life time. For example, the `componentDidMount()` function
is triggered before the React component is rendered.

3. A Higher Order Component is function that takes in another component as an
argument and returns a component. This allows developers to write code that can
conditionally render different things while keeping things "React-y".

4. 
  - `className` - use of normal `class` property in HTML elements, used with
external stylesheets

  - `style` prop - in-line styling passed as a prop to React components

  - CSS-in-JS - like the name implies, this is writing CSS code directly in the
  JavaScript
